Banking Fraud Detection Model

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent banking transactions using machine learning techniques. Multiple algorithms were explored and evaluated, including:
-----Random Forest
-----Decision Trees
----- XGBoost
-----Logistic Regression

The final model was selected after several iterations involving:
-----Feature engineering and selection
-----Pipeline optimization
-----Model tuning and experimentation

Performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix and metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, especially focusing on detecting fraud in an imbalanced dataset.
